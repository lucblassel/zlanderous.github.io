# Who am I ?

My name is Luc Blassel, I'm currently working as a bio-informatician at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. I'm quite intereseted in everything machine learning, so I made this site to try and explain some methods in depth, and hopefully re-implement them. I hope this is useful to some of you!  
Cheers
