This the repo for my site where I explain machine learning concepts and try to reimplement them.  
You can take a look at [https://lucblassel.com](https://lucblassel.com)

Any code for articles are in the following repo: [lucblassel/website\_projects](https://github.com/lucblassel/website_projects)  
Projects are in separate repos and linked in the writeup.  


This site is built with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
