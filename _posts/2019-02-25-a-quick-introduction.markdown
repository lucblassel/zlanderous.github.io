This website is where I plan to do little write ups on subjects I find interesting, mostly machine learning related. I will aim to be as clear as possible while staying rigorous, that's going to be a fine line to toe, but I hope I can be useful to at least a couple of you and would love to hear any feedback you have!  

cheers,
