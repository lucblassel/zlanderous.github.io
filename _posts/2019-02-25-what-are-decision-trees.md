The first subject I want to tackle on this page is decision trees. What are they? How do they work? How can I make one?  
I am planning to make a small series, rangin from explaining the concept, to implementing a decision tree inference algorithm and hopefully all the way up to implementing Random Forests.  
All right let's get started.
